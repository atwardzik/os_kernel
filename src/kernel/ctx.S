/**
 * All remaining registers must be saved to current process stack.
 *
 * After interrupt of the current process lower registers are stored on the stack.
 * In order to switch the context properly, other registers must be saved as well.
 *
 * (Fig. 1) Exception Stack Frame Format after entering ISR:
 *  ++--------+-------++------+----------------+----+----------+-------+
 *  || s15-s0 | FPSCR || xPSR | Return Address | lr | r12 (ip) | r3-r0 |        => 25 registers / 8
 *  ++--------+-------++------+----------------+----+----------+-------+
 *  ||                ||                                               ^
 *  || if FPU present ||      |                |    |          |       |
 *  ||                ||     0x1c             0x18 0x14       0x10     |-PSP
 *
 * Please note the return address and link register.
 * During normal function call the return address is saved into the link register,
 * however, during exception a special EXC_RETURN (different in various exception scenarios)
 * value is loaded by hardware into lr to indicate return from EXCEPTION when it is loaded
 * into the PC. *That is why the return address is loaded into stack frame.*
 *
 * (Fig. 2) Process stack after saving all registers by this method.
 *  +----------++---------++--------+------------+------------+
 *  | (Fig. 1) || s16-s31 || r11-r4 | CONTROL_NS | EXC_RETURN |                 => 25 + 26 = 51 registers / 10
 *  +----------++---------++--------+------------+------------+
 *             ||         ||                                  ^
